🏙️ Smart City Dataset - EDA Project

Welcome to my Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project using the Smart City Dataset!  
This project is focused on understanding the data, cleaning it, and uncovering patterns and insights related to urban infrastructure, transportation, pollution, and more.
The objective is to gain a better understanding of the dataset and identify areas for future analysis or modeling.
